Clysma
======

A Tool to See What's Inside
---------------------------

This is nothing more than an example of using
[cl-gtk2](http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-gtk2/) for now and a
little experiment to see what kind of information I can pull from a
running CL session.

Double-click on a row in the `Classes`, `Packages` and `Threads` tabs
to get the `describe` output for that row.

The `Symbols` tab is not functional at the moment since it's too slow.
It can easily be enabled in the source though.

Also the progress bar at the bottom is not used yet.
