Clysma

*note: this package has so far been tested and developed only on SBCL
 on Linux*


A Tool to See What's Inside
---------------------------

This is nothing more than an example of using
[cl-gtk2](http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-gtk2/) for now and a
little experiment to see what kind of information I can pull from a
running CL session.

Double-click on a row in one of the tabs to get the `#'describe`
output for that row.

Also the progress bar at the bottom is not used yet.
